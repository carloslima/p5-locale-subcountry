DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to convert the full name for a countries administrative
region to the code commonly used for postal addressing. The reverse lookup
can also be done.  Sub country codes are defined in "ISO 3166-2:1998,
Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions".

Sub countries are termed as states in the US and Australia, provinces
in Canada and counties in the UK and Ireland.

Names and ISO 3166-2 codes for all sub countries in a country can be
returned as either a hash or an array.

Names and ISO 3166-1 codes for all countries in the world can be
returned as either a hash or an array.

ISO 3166-2 codes can be converted to FIPS 10-4 codes. The reverse lookup can 
also be done.
